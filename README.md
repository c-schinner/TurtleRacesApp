# Turtle Races App
The Turtle Races App is a Python program that simulates a turtle race using the Turtle graphics library. 

Users can choose a turtle to bet on, and the program will randomly move the turtles forward until one of them crosses the finish line. 

If the user's chosen turtle wins, they win the bet; otherwise, they lose. The app offers a simple and interactive way to enjoy a virtual turtle race.
